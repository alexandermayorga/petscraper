                            Hi, my name is Alex and I'm a<span role="img" aria-label="laptop emoji" className='mx-2'>👨🏻‍💻</span>web developer from<span role="img" aria-label="laptop emoji" className='mx-2'>🇳🇮</span>Nicaragua currently living in Houston,TX. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Before I started this project I was initially looking for ideas to help me practice my web dev skills. I wanted to do something that combined a topic that matter to me and that other people might share an interest on. I've always been a dog person and for a long time I've been wanting to adopt one but my current situation has not allowed for it (...yet).  
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            So with that in mind, whenever I've looked at shelter websites I noticed some of them were not the most user friendly. Hence, I thought on doing something for our furry friends<span role="img" aria-label="dog emoji" className='mx-2'>🐶</span> and help them find a forever home<span role="img" aria-label="dog emoji" className='mx-2'>😊</span>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If you too are planning on owning a dog, cat, etc. I encourage you to adopt from a shelter instead of shopping/buying. You can search online about the many reasons why but below I list what I think is the most important one (<a href="https://www.greenmatters.com/p/why-adopt-dont-shop">link to article</a>):
                        </p>
                        
                        <div className="card mb-4 bg-secondary text-light">
                            <div className="card-body">
                                <blockquote>
                                        <p>
                                            There are so many reasons to adopt a dog rather than purchase one from a breeder. Every year, an estimated <strong>1.5 million adoptable shelter dogs and cats are euthanized</strong> in the U.S., according to the ASPCA — that’s because the shelters simply don’t have enough space and funding to accommodate all the animals that are brought there.
                            </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Every time an animal is adopted, a space opens up in the shelter or the rescue. So when you adopt a cat or dog, not only are you saving that animal’s life, but you are also opening up a space for another animal’s life to be saved.
