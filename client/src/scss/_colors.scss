/*
F0F4F5 - PORCELAIN
Light shades
Use this color as the background for your dark-on-light designs, or the text color of an inverted design.

2892CF - CURIOUS BLUE
Light accent
Accent colors can be used to bring attention to design elements by contrasting with the rest of the palette.

1FBA56 - MOUNTAIN MEADOW
Main brand color
This color should be eye-catching but not harsh. It can be liberally applied to your layout as its main identity.

597186 - BLUE BAYOUX
Dark accent
Another accent color to consider. Not all colors have to be used - sometimes a simple color scheme works best.

181D2E - MIRAGE
Dark shades
Use as the text color for dark-on-light designs, or as the background for inverted designs.
